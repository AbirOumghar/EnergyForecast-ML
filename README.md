<h1>Electricity Consumption Forecasting</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This project focuses on forecasting electricity consumption by analyzing time series data. We use data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, enriched with weather and holiday information, to predict electricity demand. Our analysis employs XGBoost and Random Forest models to navigate the data's complexity.</p>
<h2>Project Structure</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Data Preparation:</strong> Collection of electricity usage data, alongside weather and holiday details.</li>
  <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</strong> Examination of data to identify trends and patterns.</li>
  <li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Creation of new data features to enhance model predictions.</li>
  <li><strong>Model Building:</strong> Development of predictive models using XGBoost and Random Forest.</li>
  <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Model performance evaluation using cross-validation.</li>
  <li><strong>API Implementation:</strong> Creation of an API for deploying the predictive models.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Key Findings</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Weather and holidays significantly affect electricity consumption.</li>
  <li>XGBoost and Random Forest are effective for forecasting demand.</li>
  <li>Strategic feature engineering improves model accuracy.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This initiative illustrates the effectiveness of machine learning in predicting electricity demand accurately. Analyzing time series data and considering external factors such as weather and holidays allows us to offer insights for more informed energy management and planning.</p>
